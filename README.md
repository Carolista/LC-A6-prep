Prep for graded assignment 6 in LaunchCode's WebDev unit - Angular

Recording of live session held on 11/7/20: https://youtu.be/FTx20WaC3xI

Note: since the live session, I fixed a CSS conflict and a duplicated \*ngIf directive that caused little issues during the live session. I also added functionality to deal with items that are left blank when a list is being edited - the saveList() method goes through and removes any with empty strings before saving, and you can see when returning to the checklist that they are gone. So if you want to delete an item, just blank out its field in edit mode.

Students - FORK this to your own account and then clone down to your local machine. Use the starter-code branch to code along with the video. You can also reference the solution branch to study my code.

This is part of a larger group of practice exercises and examples for students of LaunchCode's Web Development course (unit 1). See this document for the full list of repls, respositories, etc. https://tinyurl.com/y3bn6st4
